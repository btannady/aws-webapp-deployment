# AWS Web App Deployment

This project demonstrates the process of deploying a web application on AWS using various cloud computing services, including AWS S3, EC2, and more. The project aims to automate deployment processes and manage infrastructure through AWS services, providing a fully functional deployment pipeline for web apps.

## Project Overview

- **Cloud Provider**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Services Used**: EC2, S3, IAM, Route 53, Lambda (or other depending on the project design)
- **Purpose**: To build and deploy a scalable web application using AWS, focusing on automation, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and CI/CD processes.
- **Tools Used**: 
  - Python
  - Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
  - AWS CLI

## Project Features

- **Web App Deployment**: Automate the deployment of a simple web application to AWS EC2 and S3.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use AWS services to configure the cloud environment and deploy the app.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate deployment using a CI/CD pipeline, leveraging tools like GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline (depending on what you're implementing).
- **Security Best Practices**: Set up IAM roles and access policies to manage security effectively.

## How to Set Up and Run

1. **Create an AWS Account**: If you don't already have one, [sign up for AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-webapp-deployment.git

	3.	Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python and Boto3 installed:

pip install boto3


	4.	Configure AWS CLI: If you haven’t already, configure your AWS CLI with your credentials:

aws configure


	5.	Deploy the Web App: Follow the instructions in the project to deploy the web app to AWS.

Project Structure
	•	app/: The source code for the web application.
	•	scripts/: Automation scripts to handle the deployment process.
	•	config/: Configuration files for AWS services (e.g., EC2, S3, etc.).
	•	README.md: This file.

Future Enhancements
	•	Implement a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline.
	•	Add monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch.
	•	Explore containerization with Docker and deploy on ECS or EKS.
	•	Improve security by integrating AWS IAM best practices and monitoring.
